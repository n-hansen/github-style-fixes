* Github June 2020 Redesign Reverter

Github pushed out a website redesign in June 2020. Like all modern website redesigns, I absolutely hate it,
so I wrote this browser extension to revert the changes I find most unpleasant.

** Features

- Remove ~border-radius~ from all elements.
- Make the navigation tabs look like actual tabs.
- Row borders and tighter padding in file list.

** Planned Features

- Remove unneeded margins/padding.
- Make user avatars and icons (e.g. PR review page) look "nicer."
- Remove css transitions.
- Add checkboxes for tweaks.
